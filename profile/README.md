# Introduction
SinarLog is an application, available on web (link has expired because no money) and mobile (not on play/app store sorry), that was aimed at making it easier for employees and HR to coordinate attendances and leaves. We divide employees into two roles, the staffs and their managers. Managers are also allowed to request for leaves, but they also contribute to the approval/rejection of their staffs leave requests. Furthermore, employees' overtime are also recorded in SinarLog that may benefit them of getting extra pay on payroll day. Also, SinarLog has a sophisticated clock in and clock out flow, such that it requires employees to have their location/gps service turned on because we tracked the location of employee's clock in and clock out. It has to be 5km apart for a successful attendance record.

We are confident SinarLog is a well-design and feature-rich HR management application not is better than most of free applications out there.
